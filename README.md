# Number Guesser



## Learning Goals
* Develop your skills in writing:
  * clean & organized CSS
  * DRY and organized JavaScript
* Build error handling into an application so a user has an interface that is clear and easy to use
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements

## Iteration 0 - Building out the Comp

You’ll start by building out the header and left side of the page with HTML and CSS.

## Iteration 1 - Your First MVP

Most of the requirements in this iteration will be handled in your JavaScript! You’ll create game functionality - two users can enter their names and guesses, then get feedback on if their guess was too high, too low, or correct.

## Iteration 2 - Guess Range

In this iteration, you’ll build out the functionality to let your user have a little more fun by creating their own range!

## Iteration 3 - Winning a Game

Currently, users learn that they’ve guessed correctly by seeing “BOOM!” appear on their card at the bottom of the left side. In this iteration, we are going to award each winner with a card including their game details! That way, we have a bit of a win history.

## Iteration 4 - Error Handling

By the work you’ve done with disabling and enabling buttons, you’ve already put some things in place to provide a clear UI for your user. In this iteration, you’ll put some error messaging in place so your users can do silly things like setting an impossible range or guessing outside of the range.
